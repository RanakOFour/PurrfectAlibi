A game first concieved by me and [MonoPatrick](https://github.com/MonoPatrick) as our entry for the BFX Game Jam 2024 at Bournemouth University.

A murder mystery game surrounding a cast of cute characters whose relations with eachother change everytime you play the game, exploring the connections between the characters to figure out who the murderer is.

The game did not get particularly far, but a textbox dialogue system written with [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) and implemented into the game made for a good system. In the build, there is a bug that makes it so that the character cannot move. Will probably never be fixed :(
